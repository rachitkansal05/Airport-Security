1)python preprocess.py 101_1.tif 101_2.tif
then u get pkl files 
2)python app2.py pkl1 pkl2

3)node mia2_js/generate_witness.js mia2_js/mia2.wasm input.json witness.wtns
this happens at airport terminal

4)snarkjs wtns export json witness.wtns witness.json
to view witness file at airport terminal the second place has 0 or 1 match 
5)airport trminal runs:
set up phase i have alreay done it uses that set up phase for below steps 
snarkjs wtns calculate mia2.wasm circom_input.json witness.wtns

snarkjs groth16 prove circuit_0001.zkey witness.wtns proof.json public.json

 Sends proof.json and public.json to verifier.

government runs:
bash

snarkjs groth16 verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json

â†’Sees [INFO] snarkJS: OK! if valid. this means output is valid 

snarkjs wtns export json witness.wtns witness.json
